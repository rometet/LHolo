// of Actor::getRotation().y, where 0 = south, 90 = west, 180 = north, -90 =
// east).
//
// Forward/back follow the facing and left/right are perpendicular to it; all
// four stay horizontal, so pitch never participates and a player looking
// straight down can still step sideways. Up/down stay on the world Y axis.
//
// The dominant horizontal axis wins, so a step always changes exactly one
// coordinate and diagonal facings never produce a diagonal step; ties (facing
// exactly along a diagonal) resolve to X so the same facing is always the same
// step. Non-finite yaw values produce no horizontal step; vertical hotkeys
// do not depend on yaw.

// above this keeps its own rule: pitch participates and every axis rounds
// independently, so a diagonal view produces a diagonal step. `steps` is the
// wheel's whole-notch count. Returns an invalid step when any resulting axis
// is non-finite or cannot be represented by an int.
